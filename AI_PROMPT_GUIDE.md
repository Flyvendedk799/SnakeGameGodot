Copy these prompts directly into Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.

## Frame 1: Idle Pose

```
Pixel art character sprite, side view facing right, idle standing pose,
arms relaxed at sides, feet together, neutral expression,
32x32 pixels, transparent background, clean pixel art style,

```

**Alternative for non-pixel art:**
```

cartoon style, clean lines, flat colors, transparent background,
character centered in frame, 128x128 pixels
```

## Frame 2: Mid-Step Walk

```
Same character from previous image, side view facing right,
mid-walk pose, left leg forward bent at knee, right leg back,
left arm swinging back, right arm swinging forward,
natural walking motion, pixel art style, transparent background,
32x32 pixels, maintain exact same style and colors
```

**Alternative for non-pixel art:**
```
Same 2D game character, side view facing right, walking mid-step,
one leg forward one leg back, arms swinging opposite,
cartoon style matching previous, clean lines, flat colors,
transparent background, 128x128 pixels
```

## Frame 3: Extended Walk

```
Same character from previous images, side view facing right,
extended walk pose, right leg fully extended forward,
left leg pushing off behind, right arm back, left arm forward,
maximum stride extension, pixel art style, transparent background,
32x32 pixels, maintain exact same style and colors
```

**Alternative for non-pixel art:**
```
Same 2D game character, side view facing right, extended stride pose,

## Pro Tips for Better Results

### 1. Generate All 3 in Same Session
If your AI tool supports it, generate all 3 frames in one conversation/session to maintain style consistency.

### 2. Use Reference Image
After generating Frame 1, use it as a reference/style guide for Frames 2 and 3.

### 3. Specify Size Consistently
- **Pixel Art:** 32x32 or 64x64 pixels
- **HD Sprites:** 128x128 or 256x256 pixels
- Keep all 3 frames the SAME size

### 4. Color Palette
For best results, specify a limited color palette:
```
"limited color palette of 6 colors: dark purple, medium purple,
light purple, white, yellow accent, black outline"
```

### 5. Style References
Add these to your prompt for specific styles:
- **Super Meat Boy style:** "geometric shapes, high contrast, bold colors"
- **Celeste style:** "pixel art, soft colors, detailed animation"
- **Rayman style:** "limbless character, cartoon eyes, vibrant colors"

## Quick Checklist

Before asking AI to generate:
- ✅ Decided on pixel art (32x/64x) or HD sprites (128x/256x)?
- ✅ Chosen your color palette?
- ✅ Picked a style reference (Meat Boy, Celeste, Rayman)?
- ✅ Character facing **RIGHT** in all frames?
- ✅ Transparent background specified?

After AI generates:
- ✅ All 3 frames same size?
- ✅ Colors match between frames?
- ✅ Character centered in frame?
- ✅ Actually transparent background (not white)?

## Fallback: Use AI Upscalers

If your frames come out too small or blurry:
1. Generate at small size (32x32)
2. Use AI upscaler like:
   - Topaz Gigapixel
   - waifu2x (free, for pixel art)
   - Real-ESRGAN (free)
3. Upscale to 128x128 or 256x256
